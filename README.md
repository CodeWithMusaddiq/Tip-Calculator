# Tip-Calculator
A 💡 simple and fun Tip Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🎯 This is my 2nd mini project 🧑‍💻 focused on logic building and basic frontend skills. ✨ Took help from ChatGPT for the CSS styling, while the HTML and JavaScript logic were done by me 💪 It calculates tip 💰 based on user input and includes a modern gradient UI 🎨
